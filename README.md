Notes:
The coin farm works by selling your daylight ring, I made it so you auto spawn as "Marcel Gerard", therefore if someone else has him equipped, this won't work. You may change source yourself or rejoin a new server.
As far as I know, devs patch scripts quick, I likely won't be updating often and as it's open sourced, use quick before patch.
